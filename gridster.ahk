; Layout takes on a value between -1 and 333 (at the moment, as there
; initially is only support for 9 zones). In the first instance, 
; however, only number up to 44 are considered. The 10s represent the
; left-most "super zone", while the single digits represent the right-
; most one. Only when layout >= 100 does the 100s represent the left-
; most super zone and the 10s the middle. -1 means there will only be
; large zone.
