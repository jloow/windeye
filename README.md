# vindows

This is an attempt to improve the ability to primarily use the keyboard in Win10.
The name comes from an initial attempt to implement vi-like keybindings to navigate and move windows.
This attempt also tried to lightly emulate i3 functionally (i.e. tiling window manager functionality).
Inspiration comes from `bug.n` but with an aim for something much lighter and simpler.
